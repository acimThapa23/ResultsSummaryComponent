##### Thank you FRONT-END MENTOR

I feel like what I did isn't too complicated to require a readme but I have provided some notes on css file and javascript as comments. It may come in handy as I am terrible at naming variables in proper way. Any help regarding media queries, easy and more concise way of implementing media querries in code would be helpful because I find that to be challenging, going through all of the elements and resizing, picking colors and all once again after the initial desktop layout was done.
